### Why Make This?

This game was created as part of my first major project at Ironhack Miami's Full-Stack Wed Development course. I've always been a fan of space-themed arcade games so this was a no brainer for me. 

### How to Play

Mission objective: Rescue 5 stranded atronauts lost in space while avoiding asteroids. Keep a close eye on your fuel and health. If you're running low on either, grab some that float by.

Movement: Left/Right arrow keys to rotate ship. Up arrow key to move in that direction

### Process

1. Learned how to create Canvas based games using Phaser 3.
2. Gathered all the necessary assets(sprites, sounds, animations)
3. Create an objective for the player with win/lose mechanics
4. Injected pace into the game by introducing asteroids that come hurling across the screen
5. Rendered the JavaScript Phaser scripts inside of an HTML page
6. Deployed the page to Heroku
